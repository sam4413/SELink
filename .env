READ THIS CAREFULLY:
You will need to set up a MySQL Database using PhpMyAdmin. 
Here are instructions on how to create the database:
1. Start up PhpMyAdmin using XAMPP, WampServer, etc (or anything similar)
2. Once logged in, make a new database by pressing New, and name it 'amplink'.
3. To make the table, copy the contents in the users.sql file, and paste it in the SQL Tab 
while in the database. 4 new items should be made called id, username, is_superuser,
and password. 
4. Connect the database to the .env file. To get the database host, root, and
password, you will have to go to the User Accounts page in the main menu of
phpmyadmin, and make a account. However, for the most part a 'root' user should
be already made. The default password is '123'. It is highly recommended that you 
create another user account with a stronger password, and delete the premade "root" account.

I will be making a video going through the process soon. 
Hope you enjoy using AMPLink! (Advanced Moderation Panel Linker)
